# ============= MANUALS =============


manualMotorTitle = WEG Eletric Motors


manualMotorDesc = Before starting to operate the motor, check the integrity of the power cables\n \
 and the correct connection to the mains. Gradually increase the load on the motor to avoid current peaks at the start of\n \
 operation. Monitor the motor temperature during the first few hours of operation, especially for high-power motors.


manualMotorEx = For WEG induction motors, always check the starting configuration\n \
 (star-delta or direct start) according to the manufacturer's specification\n \
 to avoid overloading at start-up.






manualGeneratorTitle = WEG Generator Operation


manualGeneratorDesc = Description: Make sure the generator is correctly installed and has the right oil and fuel levels. During\n \
 operation, constantly monitor the voltage and current parameters. Avoid overloading, as this can damage the generator and\n \
 reduce the service life of the components.


manualGeneratorEx = Practical example: For larger capacity WEG generators, it is recommended to use remote monitoring systems to check\n \
 performance and the status of components, such as fuel level and temperature.


# ============= PROCEDURES =============


eletricProceedTitle = Safety Procedure for Installing Electrical Equipment


eletricProceedDesc = Description: Before starting to install any electrical equipment, such as WEG motors and transformers,\n \
 disconnect the power supply and ground it properly. Use insulated tools and check the environment for\n \
 presence of flammable materials or risk of short circuit.


eletricProceedEx = Practical example: When installing a WEG transformer,\n \
 ensure that the control panel is properly identified and signposted to avoid incorrect connections that could cause the system to fail.






shockProceedTitle = Operations with risk of electric shock


shockProceedDesc = Description: Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as insulating gloves and safety boots,\n \
 before carrying out any maintenance or inspection on energized equipment. When operating high-voltage equipment,\n \
 follow the lockout and tagout (LOTO) procedures to ensure that the system is switched off.


shockProceedEx = Practical Example: When servicing WEG high-voltage transformers, disconnect the power supply,\n \
 use locking switches and check the absence of voltage at the terminals with a multimeter.


# ============= MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR =============


motorRepairTitle = Electric Motor Maintenance


motorRepairDesc = Description: Carry out regular inspections on the bearings, checking for abnormal noises or overheating.\n \
 Lubricate the bearings according to the manufacturer's instructions and replace them if necessary.\n \
 Check the connection of the electrical terminals and for signs of wear or corrosion.


motorRepairEx = Practical example: For WEG motors, preventive maintenance is recommended every 1,000 hours of operation,\n \
 including checking motor alignment and testing insulation resistance.






transfRepairTitle = Transformer Repair


transfRepairDesc = Description: When repairing WEG transformers, always carefully analyze the condition of each component, such as coils and bushings. If the bushings or insulators fail,\n \
 replace them immediately. In the event of a short circuit inside the transformer,\n \
 carry out insulation resistance tests and check the oil level.


transfRepairEx = Practical example: If a WEG transformer is overheating,\n \
 in addition to checking the oil level, examine the radiator and clean the fans to ensure good heat dissipation.


# ============= DIAGNOSIS AND TESTS =============


motorTestTitle = Engine running tests


motorTestDesc = Description: To ensure that the WEG motor is operating correctly, perform no-load starting tests,\n \
 monitoring the electric current and rotation. After operation,\n \
 check the motor temperature and vibrations to identify possible mechanical faults.


motorTestEx = Practical example: During load tests, monitor the motor's efficiency and whether the current is\n \
 within the parameters specified by the manufacturer to avoid damaging the equipment.






failTestTitle = Fault Diagnosis in Automation Systems


failTestDesc = Description: When diagnosing faults in WEG automation systems, such as controllers and frequency inverters,\n \
 use communication diagnostic tools such as modbus or ethernet to check for possible communication faults.\n \
 Review error logs and test sensors and actuators to ensure that all systems are working correctly.


failTestEx = Practical example: For WEG automation systems with frequency inverters,\n \
 run a variable load test to identify faults in speed and torque control processes.


# ============= CONDUCT MANUAL =============


assemblyManualTitle = Conduct in the Assembly Sector


assemblyManualDesc = In the assembly sector, employees must strictly follow WEG's safety procedures and quality standards.\n \
 They must ensure that tools and equipment are always in good condition,\n \
 carrying out periodic inspections and preventive maintenance.


assemblyManualEx = When assembling WEG electric motors, it is essential to check that the parts are correctly\n \
 aligned and that all the electrical connections are firmly tightened, preventing failures and rework.






maintenanceManualTitle = Operational Procedures in the Maintenance Sector


maintenanceManualDesc = Expected behavior:\n \
 In the maintenance sector, technicians must follow specific diagnostic and repair processes, always using the appropriate PPE and tools.\n \
 All maintenance and component changes must be recorded accurately and up to date in the company's management system.


maintenanceManualEx = When servicing a WEG frequency inverter,\n \
 the technician should carefully inspect the internal electronic components\n \
 (such as resistors and capacitors) and carry out insulation tests, ensuring the integrity and safety of the equipment.
